# Change: Search Bars for Services and Series

## Why

Navigation and lookup for services/series need faster discovery similar to song search.

## Scope

- Add search inputs to Services and Series listing views.
- Support title/slug/date text matching as appropriate per view.
- Keep existing filters/sorting behavior compatible.

## Out of Scope

- Backend/full-text index changes.
- Song search changes.

## Success Criteria

- Users can quickly find services and series by text query.
- Search behaves predictably with existing list controls.
