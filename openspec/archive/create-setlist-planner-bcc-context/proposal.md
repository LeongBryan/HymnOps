# Change: Create Setlist Planner for BCC Context

## Why

Current setlist created exports as Markdown, which is useful only for devs (2 users in the church). The useful function would create a copy-pastable message for whatsapp sharing. Furthermore, the church context "Usage" categories are only 'kid-friendly', 'main', and 'response'. Update all service usages accordingly and appropriate changes.

## Scope

- Add explicit "Export For Whatsapp" button that simply lists the songs with categories: kids-friendly, main, response. it should be succinct rather than verbose.
- Update all service usages according to "Usage" categories 'kid-friendly', 'main', and 'response' and make other appropriate changes.

## Success Criteria

- All Services have Songs with correct 'usage' category. 
- Users can click "Export For Whatsapp" button, which saves to their clipboard as well as displays the output that would come up, like current Export Service Markdown button.
